During the [6th Heidelberg Laureate Forum (6HLF)](https://www.heidelberg-laureate-forum.org/forum/past-hlfs/6th-hlf-2018.html), I had the chance of meeting in person the legendary [Michael Atiyah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Atiyah). Even if one was unfamiliar with his mathematical work, Atiyah had passed to the collective consciousness of mathematicians all around the world and all around this science thanks to his famous book together with [Ian G. Macdonald](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_G._Macdonald): [*Introduction to Commutative Algebra*](https://www.maa.org/press/maa-reviews/introduction-to-commutative-algebra). This book has been a classic in the teaching of commutative algebra since the 80s and, despite its shortcomings, it has the advantage of being a short introduction when compared to other books in the topic—including those published nowadays.

# The Moment Itself in which I met Atiyah

The day was September 26, 2018. On the afternoon, we were making a boat-tour along [the river Neckar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neckar) where the point was not so much to see the river banks as to interact with the people in the boat, among those you could find many laureates. Of course, knowing that Atiyah would be at the encounter, I had brought with me my copy of the famous commutative algebra book that had accompanied me so many hours and days during voyages through the world of algebra. As other days during the 6HLF, I carried with me the book ready to get a signature from Atiyah, but not without nervousness.

During that boat-tour, the awaited moment arraived. Atiyah had finished talking to a group and he was alone, an window of opportunity has just opened. Nervous as expected, [Giulia Codenotti](https://www.math.uni-frankfurt.de/~codenott/)—at the time doing the PhD also in the [Berlin Mathematical School](https://www.math-berlin.de/)—gave the final push for me to approach—that's what friends are for. So we approach Atiyah, and the conversation started, more through the talkativeness of Atiyah than by our own.

The conversation was very one-sided, but none of the listeners there—[Peter Huxford](https://math.uchicago.edu/~huxford/), Giulia or myself—complained, since it is not everyday that you get this window to the life stories of a living legend. Atiyah talked about his personal background (including his Lebanese origins on the father's side) and share some stories about his life, which unfortunately were told too long ago for me to remember.

Of course, during the conversation, like any regular fanboy, I asked for a signature—an autograph—for the book and got it. Because of this, the conversation turned towards the book. Atiyah recalled how the book came to be as a product of a lecture he gave when he was young. The book came out as the lecture notes of that class, where Macdonald took care of the exercises. Funnily, he complained of how he still received questions about the exercises, complaining of how hard some of these were and how he had anything to do with them.

# The Sad Circumstances of this Moment

Unfortunately, this moment didn't happen in the best circumstances. The 6HLF is infamous for Atiyah's presentation of his 'proof' of [Riemann hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_hypothesis). The presented proof was more the proof of a crank than the proof of a mathematical genius such as Atiyah, and it ruined whatever reputation he preserved as an active mathematician. Of course, he will always be remenbered as a great mathematician, but that talk was the fall from grace and one of the saddest way for such a mathematician to end his career.

However, why was Atiyah allowed to give such a talk in such a public forum as the 6HLF? And more importantly, what does this say about the mathematical community? The easy answer would be to blame Atiyah, and not to think any longer. At the closing ceremony of the 6HLF, great claims were made about Academic freedom, about how the speakers at the HLF could talk about what they wish. Unfortunately, this line of thought moves all the responsability away from the HLF, as if the program was not decided in advance.

Taking into account that the talks of the HLF are streamed and recorded, accessible for all the people in the world, the HLF has a responsability in how it broadcasts the image of mathematicians to the world.

could we really use Academic freedom as a shield?

obviates the obvious: the program of the HLF is decided in advance.

 , about the benefits of Academic freedom, but what if some of the speakers wanted to talk about the mathematics of bomb-making? Would the HLF claim the same values for freedom,  were these claims reales



alone and not to take any responsability about the fact, since the actions of another person do not form part of our responsabilities. [^1]









[^1]: All of this was confirmed in private conversation with the personal research assistant of Atiyah at the time. For the sake of responsability, I will not reveal this person's identity—one thing is putting myself on the line of fire, other thing is to put other people in that line. <!--[Carlos Zapata Carratalá](https://czapatacarratala.wixsite.com/home) @ZapataCarratala-->
