Whatever moves around in my head is most likely not an original thought. My head is full of the sound of the voices of the people I have read or listened. My thoughts are not mine, but just the superposition of all the echos of the voices—own or alien—resonating in the walls of my skull. In this paradox, where the boundary between the I and the circumstance blurs, I live without an original idea 

but just the superposition of the echos of a thousand read/heard voices resonating in the walls of my skull. My thoughts are just like yesterday's meal reheated in the microwave. Thus there is no way of saying them well.

Thinking is an easy task, thinking something original is a difficult task, and thinking something that is both original and interesting—whatever the latter means—is an almost impossible task. In this blog, we will have thoughts, but probably neither original nor interesting.

To say something is supposed to be easier than to write something. The latter requires a certain kind of reflection, revision, rewrites,
Writing is always quite a formal way of expressing
This blog is intended as a medium where I can express myself freely.
My intention with this blog is having a place where I can type quick thoughts... Here I will write a sufficiently long paragraph, because I need to check how this parses them in a linebreak.

If $x>7\sin x$ then...f
$$x^2<5$$
