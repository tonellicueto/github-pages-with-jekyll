# 2021

2020 went under,  
2021 goes over.

Will this 2021 let us  
emerge to the overworld?  
Or will it keep us  
locked in the underworld?

2020 undertook us,  
it beat us down;  
this 2021, we'll rise up,  
we will overtake...  
     ...ourselves,  
        ...circumstances,  
           ...and this new year!

# 2020

Another loop  
in the cycle;  
one counter restarts,  
another adds one  
and equals 2x20.  
¡Feliz 2020!

# 2019

???

# 2018

2017 was prime,  
of 2018,  
only its half is;  
let it, this new year,  
the other way around be,  
that what 2017 gave  
the half of what 2018 will give becomes.

# 2017[^transl17]

As Sisyphus, each year, we carry our rock so we forget it when we reach the top and we start again to carry it up. Happy 2017 and that in this new year the rock becomes lighter!

[^transl17]: Este texto cuenta con traducción al castellano:

             Tal cual Sísifo, cada año cargamos nuestra roca para después olvidarla al llegar arriba y empezar a subirla de nuevo. ¡Feliz 2017 y que en este nuevo año sea la roca m&aacute;s ligera!
