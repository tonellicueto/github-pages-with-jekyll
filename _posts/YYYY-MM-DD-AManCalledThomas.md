Trying to scape my inner feelings, as I navigate them intensely while writing the lecture notes for the course in probability and statistics I will start teaching this coming semester, I decided to take a walk. Initially, I planned to go somewhere around the Washington Monument in downtown in Baltimore and then go back. However, as my thoughts continued fighting with my feelings, I did the only thing that one can do in these cases: continue walking with a sense of where one is going but going nowhere.

Walking through the inner streets of Baltimore is always an experience in which one is confronted with the forgotten of the USian society. At one corner and another, you can see the many homeless people. After months of walking, some of these are not complete strangers anymore, but acquitances of the street that provide some familiarity to these USian streets where only the car should pass. Although probably not the most popular option, I try in the measure of the possible[^mp] to answer back when they intercept you in the street. Despite the beaten-by-the-streets appearance that they carry, we cannot disregard their humanity: they are humans like us, humans in a hard situation, but a situation to which any of us can descend given the propper conditions. As such, as humans, we owe them what we owe to every other person: to treat them with human dignity. And sometimes, this is as simple as being seen and not ignored by us. As the social beings that we are, the recognition of the other humanizes us.+

   [mp]: As with everything else, one should exercise caution. In general, homeless people are harmless. However, some of them, after years and years in the street, suffer from serious mental illnesses and can act violently when interacted with. This possibility is very unlikely—majority of homeless people I have interacted with are cordial despite whichever mental illness they could have—but one should pay attention just in case.

After rejecting the offer by a person in the corner to exchange the skirt I was wearing with the pants she was wearing—because she was a girl—, I advanced until an old man said something to me. Of course, me, the non-native speaker carrying headphones never fully understands what is said to me in English not at the first time not at the second time. But at the third time, I was able to gather what this man was asking, ...

talking with thomas


arriving to the bus stop

After leaving the quite light-for-me, but wuite heavy for Thomas bag in the bench of the bus stop. Thomas thanked me and we hand shaked in a departure gesture. In a sense, as with many other extrangers that cross our life, I will probably not see Thomas again. However, I cannot do other thing but wonder about the life of this person. What brought this person to this point?

Unable to answer all these concerns, I just continue walking as my mind went back to my feeling, worries and the sense of melancholy that was flooding me at the moment.
