A *straw feminist*[^1] is a trope used to exaggerate/misrepresent feminist views in order to characterize feminism as something that does not make sense. As feminism is a plural movement, feminists hold diverse positions and so debate and disagreement is something normal within feminism. Thus one can disagree with certain feminist positions. However, a *straw feminist* attack does not intend an honest rigorous debate, a *straw feminist* attack presents an easy-to-refute (and many times absurd/exaggerated/outrageous) position as a mainstream position within feminism even though no significant part of feminism holds the supposed position. In this way, *straw feminist* attacks are not innocent. Moreover, these attacks form part of a wider context of hostile attacks and stands against feminism whose objective is to discredit the movement at any cost. In this series of posts, I don't intend only to disprove particular *straw feminist* attacks, but also to show the wider context in which they take place.

In the 80s, feminist studies of science emerged as a discipline in its own right. Throughout history—and still today—, we can find examples of how *sexist science* appears and develops. In order to explain how *sexist science* appears, feminist studies of science criticize science as a value-free activity, arguing that, as any other human activity, science is influenced by the contextual values of the society in which it takes place. Among the early women that engaged with these feminist analyses of science in the 80s, we can highlight Donna Haraway, Evelyn Fox Keller, Carolyn Merchant and Sandra Harding.



Such analyses have been criticized by people.


The main point of many of these analyses was to question science as a value-free activity and to show that

In the early 90s, at the same time that feminist analyses of science started to develop even further—see for example the work of Anne Fausto-Sterling, Helen Longino and Lynn Hankinson Nelson among others—, a strong pushback against the feminist discourse on science started.


At this point of the story is where we find the the *straw feminist* attack that concern us today: Newton's rape manual. In the section *The Furor over Feminist Science* of the article *Science versus Antiscience?* (1997) from Scientific American[^sa], we can find the following quote:

>Critics who accuse feminist science studies of being antiscience often cite the most radical scholarship—such as philosopher Sandra Harding’s charge that Isaac Newton’s Principia Mathematica is a “rape manual.” Although feminists have taken a particularly hard hit in recent skirmishes between “the two cultures,” they certainly have not held up a white flag.

Of course, we might think that this is an isolated quote. However, we can find this statement in several works. The most likely origin for the above claim is the book *Higher Superstition: The Academic Left and Its Quarrels with Science* (1994) by Paul R. Gross and Norman Levitt. In this book we can find the following quote:

>[...] But these are not atypical, nor are they her most redolent remarks. Her stirring assertion to the effect that Newton’s Principia Mathematica Philosophae Naturalis is a “rape manual” may well have won her a lasting admiration in doctrinaire feminist circles and even a place among physicists. [...]

Later on, we can find this claim in several works on Dawkins...


Now, what did Sandra Harding really say? If we go the book *The Science Question in Feminism*, we can find, in the 5th chapter, the famous quote:

> One phenomenon feminist historians have focused on is the rape and torture metaphors in the w ritings of Sir Francis Bacon and others (e.g., Machiavelli) enthusiastic about the new scientific method. Traditional historians and philosophers have said that these metaphors are irrelevant to the *real* meanings and referents of scientific concepts held bv those who used them and by the public for whom they wrote. But when it comes to regarding nature as a machine, they have quite a different analysis: here, we are told, the metaphor provides the interpretations of Newton's mathematical laws: it directs inquirers to fruitful ways to apply his theory and suggests the appropriate methods of inquiry and the kind of metaphysics the new theory supports. But if
we are to believe that mechanistic metaphors were a fundamental component of the explanations the new science provided, why should we believe that the gender metaphors were not? A consistent analysis would lead to the conclusion that understanding nature as a woman indifferent to or even welcoming rape w as equally fundamental to the interpretations of these new conceptions of nature and inquiry. Presumably these metaphors, too, had fruitful pragmatic, methodological, and metaphysical consequences for science. In that case, why is it not as illuminating and honest to refer to Newton's laws as &ldquo;Newton's rape manual&rdquo; as it is to call them &ldquo;Newton's mechanics&rdquo;?

However, after reading the full paragraph in which it appear, we must wonder: Is Sandra Harding really saying that Isaac Newton’s Principia Mathematica is a “rape manual”? Clearly no. However, note that straw feminists are not intended to be accurate, but to ridicule feminism. In this way, where Sandra Harding is arguing that we cannot disregard sexual metaphors at the beginning of science as unimportant while we give importance to the mechanical metaphors of the time, the opponents misread the

In a talk given by Sandra Harding "Objectivity and Diversity: Tensions for Feminist Postcolonial Research" on the 13th of November of 2013 in the iSchool Colloquia 2013-2014 *Feminist & Queer: Approaches to Technoscience* at the University of Toronto [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_qa87-54yQ&t=5701s], we can hear Sandra Harding saying:

>Funding is another matter. Fortunately, I am a philosopher. So I don't need a lot of funding to do my work. That's one thing. That different fields have different kinds of funding needs. The second thing to be said in my own case is that I have not had major foundation funding for about thirty years. And I certainly think that to this day I would not be able to get NSF funding, although I am constantly a reviewer for NSF—they call me, they know I can do the reviews. The reason is that the right wing went after me from the John Birch Society through the Science Wars, so federeal funding agencies in the US know that they will be attack if their money is going to that devil Sandra Harding. My Wikipedia site—I don't pay too much attention to it—is within between six to eighteen hours updated with right wing stuff. Every time I ask a friend to take it off. What they focus on is one sentence, from a book that is 27 years old, which I thought as a joke. I won't repeat it, because some of you know it already.

>That's a peculiar set of historical circumstances: the demonization of feminism and I was an easy target for them. If you forgive me, I'm bigger than that now, it doesn't bother me, I don't care, but it does shape possibilities of funding for me. Fortunately I haven't really needed funding. I took administrative positions instead. I know that this seems totally wild to people, but for twenty years I thaught half time as I directed very major feminist institutions: I coedited the journal *signs*—a journal of women and culture in society, that is not *science*, *signs*—and I directed the Women Studies program at the University of Delaware, which was huge, and the UCLA Centre for the Study of Women, which is a research institute not an academic program. They have different work patterns than does full time teaching and so I wrote all my book on those jobs, I mean not all but certainly almost all.

>Funding is hard to get, and specially not easy now when there are cut backs in funding everywhere in federal goverment and everywhere else. And you are right, funding determines what gets done, certainly, in the natural science and in most of the social sciences. Social sciences do big science, you need funding to go run that research, to travel to Africa or Latinamerica or wherever you are doing your research. So it is an issue I have no solutions to it. But I think that helping graduate students how to get it is a really good project.
