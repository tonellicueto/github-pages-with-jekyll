Who writes  
what comes?  

God?  
The spirit  
of history?  
The stars?  
The planets?  
The lines  
of the hand?  
The cards?

Arbitrary signals,  
arbitrarily given,  
arbitrarily read,  
of a future  
still unwritten.

As we restart time  
at this arbitrary point,  
throw away  
those arbitrary chains  
aiming to write  
what we must write.

The unwritten future  
belong to us,  
we will write it  
while answering  
with our lives  
the circumstances  
we always inhabit.

Our only fate:  
to write  
our unwritten future.

¡Feliz ((3^2)5)^2 !

Each year, I send an SMS congratulating the new year to my friends and some acquaintances exactly when the new year arrives (where I am). Each SMS contains a poem or a poetic/lyric text whose thematic varies from year to year. This tradition of my own goes back to several years ago—although I can't remember when I started. Since a while I have been sharing these SMSs in this blog.
