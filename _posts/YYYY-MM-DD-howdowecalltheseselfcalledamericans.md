English language reflects the dominance of the US perspective[^listcountries]:
Americans from Canada are Canadians,
Americans from Mexico, Mexicans;
Americans from Cuba, Cubans;
Americans from Colombia, Colombians;
Americans from Venezuela, Venezuelans;
Americans from Brazil, Brazilians;
Americans from Ecuador, Ecuadorians;
Americans from Peru, Peruvians;
Americans from Bolivia, Bolivians;
Americans from Paraguay, Paraguayans;
Americans from Chile, Chileans;
Americans from Uruguay, Uruguayans;
Americans from Argentina, Argentinians...
However, Americans from the United States (of America) are just Americans.

[^listcountries]: The list that follows is large. However, this list misses the rest of the remaining 21 countries of the Americas (Antigua and Barbuda, Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Costa Rica, Dominica, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Grenada, Guatemala, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, Jamaica, Nicaragua, Panama, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucas, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Suriname, and Trinidad and Tobago), and we have to take into account that are territories in the Americas that are not independent countries.

In this paradoxical denomination, these self-called Americans claim the whole Americas for themselves, while at the same time excluding the other Americans from their 'America'. This situation is very similar to that situation in which the self-called men claim humanity for themselves, while at the same time excluding women from their 'humanity'. In other words, while the latter linguistic use reflects patriarchy, the former reflects US imperialism, which by some idiots is wrongly called American imperialism. The self-called Americans have historically intervened in the rest of the Americas with little regard to the Americans there and against any democratic movement of the Americas.

Even in the Spanish language, one of the few languages[^exmlang] where the self-called Americans are not just Americans, but _estadounidenses_ (unitedestatesians?), we can se the effect of US imperialism. It is not uncommon in the Spanish language, even among the 'sophisticated Argentinian speakers'[^AS], to refer to people in the US as just Americans. Is the case that the Spanish-speaking America has surrendered to the US empire? Of course not, but we cannot deny that a big part of our collective narratives have been modelled by the US through their media industries[^softpower].  

[^exmlang]: Except for the Spanish and Portuguese, the rest of languages concedes to US imperialism and calls US people Americans. This is so even in the language of the self-called _avant-garde_ of European culture and thinking: the French.
[^AS]: Of course, the Uruguayan speakers are more sophisticated, but this writer knows how to count!  
[^softpower]: While some European countries believe they achieve _soft power_ by educating the elites of foreign countries at their universities, we should not deny that the US through Hollywood and the other media production companies has obtained a soft power over the masses of the world that can attend neither the European universities nor the US ones.

Towards such a level of cultural and political[^mili] US domination, we cannot do other thing than to resist. But, how? Resisting means to declare our otherness in an explicit way, to accept the constant threat. 

Resistance is not easy, it means to take an stance against the mayor tendencies, to declare oneself as the other. When we resist, we are insisting in our otherness, in our difference with the collective.

If you are an American in the US, how can you defy the US centric narrative without rejecting becoming one more person in the US? Resistance means

 Unfortunately, how can the resistance penetrate the language of the empire and conquer the denomination of it?


 Even more, how can the immigrants into the US resist without rejecting the so desired integration?

[^mili]: And military!

In doing such an act of resistance, we might find the US right in front of us saying that they call themselves Americans and their country America. However, against these right-wing players, we can reflect their usual arguments agains the transgender community, how the people of the US wants to call themselves and their country is irrelevant!

these self-called Americans claim that they are the true American nation, because these self-called American also called their nation simply America. The name that used to denote the whole of the Americas is now the name of a very particular region: the United States of America.

the rule of the Americas while at the same time excluding the rest of the Americans.
