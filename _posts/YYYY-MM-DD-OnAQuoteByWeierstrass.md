A famous quote in many math circles is the following quote:


The following is a paraphrasing (to avoid certain antisemitic comments of the time) of a quote in a letter to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sofya_Kovalevskaya">Sofia Kovalevskaya</a>:</p>
<blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantor%27s_paradise" style="text-align:center;font-variant: small-caps;">
[A] defect found in many highly intelligent people [is that] they lack imagination (I prefer to say intuition) and it is true that a mathematician who is not somewhat of a poet will never be fully a mathematician.
<!--Added to this is a defect found in many highly intelligent people, especially those of the Semitic tribe, they lack imagination (I prefer to say intuition) and it is true that a mathematician who is not somewhat of a poet will never be fully a mathematician.-->
</blockquote><!--Letter to Sofia Kovalevskaya, August 27, 1883, as shared by Gösta Mittag-Leffler at the 2nd International Congress for Mathematicians in Paris. Compte rendu du deuxième Congrès international des mathematiciens tenu à Paris du 6 au 12 août 1900, Gauthier-Villars (Paris), 1902, page 149.-->

This blog is intended as a medium where I can express myself freely.
My intention with this blog is having a place where I can type quick thoughts... Here I will write a sufficiently long paragraph, because I need to check how this parses them in a linebreak.

If $x>7\sin x$ then...f
$$x^2<5$$
