excerpt: |
   After giving You our life, Mathematics,  
   which theorem will You reveal to us?  
   Long after we are not longer remembered,  
   will our names still inhabit Your world?  
   Once humanity becomes extinct in the universe,  
   will You still be there?  
   Or will You go away with all these other abstractions of the naked monkeys?

This poem can be found at the end of the <a href="https://tonellicueto.xyz/doctoralthesis.html">doctoral thesis &ldquo;Condition and Homology in Semialgebraic Geometry&rdquo; by Josué Tonelli Cueto</a>. The thesis was defended and published in 2019. The poem expressed my mental state and feelings when finally submitting the thesis, after several months of constant writing.
