<div class="jumbotron abstract" style="font-style: italic;">
If number theory is the queen of mathematics, linear algebra is its working class—ignored by the upper classes, linear algebra does the heavy work underneath. In this series of posts, I intend to share those examples of linear algebra at work to showcase not only the beauty of linear algebra but its simplifying and unifying power.
