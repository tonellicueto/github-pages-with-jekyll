We believe in free speech and the right of anyone to express their opinions about the posts in this blog. However, free speech cannot be an effective right for everyone in a hostile environment. Because of this, we will moderate comments to create an environment in which everyone feels that e can share freely and openly eir opinions. We will remove any comment, regardless of the expressed opinion, that do not contribute to create such an environment.

The following list of rules is not exhaustive in any way, but it should give an idea of the limits we impose.

1. Stay on topic—comments should be related to the post that they are commenting.
1. Don't advertise. Don't spam.
1. Be civic and respectful with the author and other commenters.
1. Harassment of any kind (see definition below) will not be tolerated at all.
1. Any hate speech, sexist, racist or discriminatory comments will not be tolerated at all.

Note that, as the list above is not exhaustive, satisfying all the rules is a necessary, but not sufficient condition for commenting.

### Definition of harassment
